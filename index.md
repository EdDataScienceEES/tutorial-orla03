Often in data science we want to predict where the data might fall. A confidence interval gives us a range of plausible values in which our true value might lie; this is essential in ecologicial data science and often used to assess the importance of true effects!

If you are interested in how to find confidence intervals in R and how to plot these results to better visualise where the true value might lie, this is the tutorial for you!

## 1.2 Understanding Confidence Intervals

## Why do we want to find confidence intervals?

Confidence intervals often help data scientists make informed decisions based on the data we are working with, 
this allows deeper understanding of their next steps and why data has been modelled in a specific way. 
Confidence intervals are crucial in ecological and enviornmental data analysis because they provide a way to assess reliability, support decision-making, and improve the interpretability of  data. 
They help ensure that ecological conclusions are based on an understanding of the data at hand and of the variability and uncertainty inherent in ecological data. We often will not have perfect data and will need to 
analyse the data we are using through data wrangling or such techniques!

## How do we begin our approach to finding a suitable confidence interval?

Within this tutorial we want to first find a linear model suitable to the research question we are addressing. 

<a name="section1.3"></a>

## 1.3 Introducing the Data

The data we will be using to begin with is a `trees` dataset built into the `ggplot2` package in R.
Let's load the package and get a basic understanding of the data.

```r
# Load package
library(ggplot2)

# If you don't have the package installed already, do so by uncommenting the code below
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# This line of code is essential for installing any packages you don't have already!

# Loading data
data(trees)
# Note: the data will now appear as `trees` in your R Studio environment.
```
Having a basic understanding of the data is essential prior to any task.

### How many variables does the dataset include, and how many observations?

{% capture reveal %}

The data has 31 observations with 3 different variables: Girth, Height and Volume.

{% endcapture %} 
{% include reveal.html button="Click for the answer" content=reveal %}

We will now begin through this tutorial.

<a name="section2"></a>

## 2. Learning how to use linear models and find their confidence intervals.

We will begin by constructing a simple linear model for the `trees` data and subsequently 
constructing relevant confidence intervals. Our aim here is to investigate the correlation between tree girth and tree height. 

Before we begin, recall that a simple linear model is built via the response variable being predicted by the predictor.

```r
# Constuct a simple linear model 
model <- lm(Girth ~ Height, data = trees) 
```

Recall from our previous tutorial, we must check there are no violation of the assumptions;
we essentially require constant variance (homoscedasticity), normally distributed residuals and independent variables.


```r
# Plot to check no violation of assumptions
par(mfrow = c(2,2)) # plots the four plots on one panel
plot(model)
# seems okay no clear violation!
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figures/model_1.png" alt="Img" style="width: 500px;"/> </center>

We can see from the top left plot, the residuals seem quite evenly distributed either side of the line.
The QQ-plot shows us that the residuals follow the shape of a normal distribution but could be improved.
The scale-location plot shows signs of linearity.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are not focussing on improving our linear model. Note that this model is not perfect and could be improved!
Head to the following tutorial for a thorough guide on how to improve this basic model. 

#### <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/model-design/"> Intro to Model Design</a>

Continuing on we will analyse the models summary. In r it is ALWAYS a good idea to have a look at the summary to evaluate linear models.

```r
summary(model) # Print the summary of our model
```

We will begin by gaining a basic understanding of why the summary is useful for later in the tutorial. 
The red box shows the model estimates for each coefficient; in our case these are the intercept and Height. Followed by the purple box showing the models standard errors.
Finally the blue shows the degrees of freedom for our linear model. 

### What are degrees of freedom?

These are the number of independent variables that can vary. For example, in our data set we have 31 observations but 2 independent variables in our model, hence $31 - 2 = 29$ df.
This will prove beneficial in constructing confidence intervals later.

Final note: the Adjusted R-squared is significantly low for our model at 0.2445. This means only 24% of the data is accounted for by this model. Not ideal!

We can now plot the linear model as follows.

```r
plot(Girth ~ Height, data = trees)
abline(model)
```
<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figures/model_2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>

The model shows the raw data points with a consistent increase in tree girth with height.

We will now find Confidence intervals for our model. R has a built in function to find confidence intervals, however we will manually find these intervals and then test against the function.
Within data science we generally need an understanding of how to find the mean, standard error, t-score, and margins of error, this step-by-step solution is just the beginning of your statistical analysis!

Learning how to construct a confidence interval in essential in ecology, as we often need to fully understand how to analyse a confidence interval, building these together will give you a thorough understanding of the code R undertakes.

```r
# We will print the summary of our model then extract the relevant information
(sum_m <- summary(model))

# We extract the models coeeficients from the estimates in our summary 
model_est <- coef(model)

# We extract the standard errors
model_se <- sum_m$coefficients[, 2]  # the use of 2 takes us to the coeffecients then the 2nd column

# We now find our sample size
sample <- length(trees$Girth)

# We now find the degrees of freedom
# In a simple linear regression model with one predictor variable, 
# the degrees of freedom is calculated as n â€“ 2, where n is the total number of observations.

degrees_freedom <- sample - 2 
degrees_freedom
```
Insert code snippet!!
Correct! The degrees of freedom match our summary!

We will now introduce significance levels; these are highly important and coherent with the level chosen as alpha. 
For example, when computing a 95% confidence interval, this suggests our value of alpha will be 5% and the associated
confidence interval output will give us a numerical value for the data at 2.5% and 97.5%. 
Don't worry too much here, R has a default of 95% level.
We will understand mathematically the formula for a Confidence Interval, this will help with construction. 


```r
# Calculate t-score for 95% confidence interval
# We use the qt function here!
alpha <- 0.05 # alpha is 0.05 for a 95% conf interval
score <- qt(p = alpha / 2, df = degrees_freedom, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Calculate margin of error for the coefficients
margin <- score * model_se # this stems from the equation above.

# Calculate the confidence intervals (lower and upper bounds)
lower_bounds <- model_est - margin
upper_bounds <- model_est + margin

# Combine the lower and upper bounds
combined_bounds <- cbind(lower_bounds, upper_bounds)

# Print the confidence intervals
print(combined_bounds)

```

insert the conf intervals printed!!!!!!

We will now check our values against the built in r function.

```r
# Compare to the built in r function!
confint(model, level=0.95)
```
insert output

Success!! These numbers match, this gives us an idea of the way these intervals can be interpreted.

## 3. Learn how to plot the confidence intervals and compare these.

Simply finding these intervals helps with analysis, but as data scientists we want to be able to visualise our data!

Lets plot the intervals.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Model coefficients and confidence intervals into a data frame
coef_data <- data.frame(
  term = names(model_est),
  estimate = model_est,             # Point estimates from the model
  lower = lower_bounds,            # Lower bounds of the confidence intervals
  upper = upper_bounds)            # Upper bounds of the confidence intervals

# Create the plot
# 95% conf intervals!!
ggplot(data = coef_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = term, y = estimate), color = "deeppink", size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = term, ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.4, color = "black", size = 0.5)+
  geom_text(aes(x = term, y = lower, label = lower,  vjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = term, y = upper, label = upper,  vjust = -1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Confidence Intervals for Model Coefficients",
       x = "Term", 
       y = "Estimate")

```
<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figures/Conf-Int.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>

This shows us that the confidence interval for the intercept is much larger than for the Height variable, we would expect this.

### Have a think, what kind of confidence intervals do we want?

{% capture reveal %}

Narrow confidence intervals show more precision within a model since genrerally a narrow confidence interval represents a better model due to more precision in the estimates. 

{% endcapture %}

We have seen how to model the coefficients and the confidence intervals, what about the data we predict?
Often when working with data in ecology, we want to predict what our future model might look like
So far, we have plotted confidence intervals for the model parameters - the intercept and slope
You might be thinking but what about future predictions?
Good question, lets find out!!

R has a prediction function within the `ggeffects` package. We can find confidence levels in future predictions.

```r
# Extract the prediction data frame
pred_m <- ggpredict(model, terms = c("Height"))  # this gives overall predictions for the Height
```

```r
# 95% conf intervals!!
ggplot(data = pred_m) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = predicted), color = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = x, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.4, color = "black", size = 0.5)+
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = conf.low, label = round(conf.low, 1),  vjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = conf.high, label = round(conf.high, 1),  vjust = -1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Confidence Intervals for Model Coefficients",
       x = "Height", 
       y = "Prediction")
```
<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figures/Conf-Int-2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>

We may now ask but what is the difference between a confidence interval and a prediction interval?
Good question, lets find out!
A prediction interval is less certain than a confidence interval. A prediction interval predicts an individual number, whereas a confidence interval predicts the mean value.


```r
#create data frame with three new values for Height
new_height <- data.frame(Height= c(90, 100, 110))

# Use the fitted model to predict the value for Girth based on the three new values for height
predict(model, newdata = new_height) # newdata is the new data frame
```

This shows us that for a tree with tree height of 90, the predicted tree girth is 16.76 **put in a table

We will now predict the intervals for our hwight values from the `trees` dataframe.

```r
# create the prediction intervals
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = trees, interval = "predict", level = 0.95)
# 95% prediction interval for Tree girth with a height of 90 is 10.58 to 22.93

# create dataset that contains original data along with prediction intervals
combined <- cbind(trees, predictions) # Add new column to combined

ggplot(combined, aes(x = Height, y = Girth)) + #define x and y variables
  geom_point() + # add raw data points
  stat_smooth(method = lm) + # add the linear model 
  geom_line(aes(y = lwr), col = "red", linetype = "dashed") + # lower prediction interval
  geom_line(aes(y = upr), col = "red", linetype = "dashed") # upper prediction interval

```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figures/Prediction-plot.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>

What do we expect when we move to a 99% prediction interval?

Intuitively, when we more to 99% intervals, we are predicting a larger interval in which there is 99% probability the predicted value lies in thei interval, 
therefore the interval will be LARGER.
