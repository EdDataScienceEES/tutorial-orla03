# Tutorial draft
# We begin by taking a look at confidence intervals for a simple trees dataset
# Load packages ----
library(ggplot2)

# Loading data
data(trees)

# Build a linear model for trees  
plot(Girth ~ Height, data = trees, pch = 16)
model <- lm(Girth ~ Height, data = trees)
summary(model)
coef(model)

# Plot to check no violation of assumptions
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model)
# seems okay no clear violation!

plot(Girth ~ Height, data = trees, pch = 16)
abline(model)




# We will now find Confidence intervals for our model.
# R has a built in function to find confidence intervals, however we will manually find these intervals and then test against the function
# We need an understanding of how to find the mean, standard error, t-score, and margins of error
model <- lm(Girth ~ Height, data = trees)

# Learning how to construct a confidence interval in essential in ecology, as we often need to fully understand how to analyse a confidence interval.
# We will print the summary of our model then extract the relevant information
(sum_m <- summary(model))

# We extract the models coeeficients from the estimates in our summary 
model_est <- coef(model)
# We extract the standard errors
model_se <- sum_m$coefficients[, 2]  # the use of 2 takes us to the coeffecients then the 2nd column

# We now find our sample size
sample <- length(trees$Girth)

# We now find the degrees of freedom
# In a simple linear regression model with one predictor variable, 
# the degrees of freedom is calculated as n â€“ 2, where n is the total number of observations.

degrees_freedom <- sample - 2 
degrees_freedom

# Calculate t-score for 95% confidence interval
# We use the qt function here!
alpha <- 0.05 # alpha is 0.05 for a 95% conf interval
score <- qt(p = alpha / 2, df = degrees_freedom, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Calculate margin of error for the coefficients
margin <- score * model_se

# Calculate the confidence intervals (lower and upper bounds)
lower_bounds <- model_est - margin
upper_bounds <- model_est + margin

# Print the confidence intervals
print(cbind(lower_bounds, upper_bounds))


# Compare to the built in r function!
confint(model, level=0.95)

# We will now learn to plot confidence intervals in R!
