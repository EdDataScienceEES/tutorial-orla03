Often in data science and quantitative statistics, confidence intervals are easily misinterpreted or not used properly. This tutorial communicates an efficient way of find confidence intervals and illustrates different visualisation techniques to view the results.
The tutorial teaches the basic skills of constructing and interpreting confidence intervals, we then look at a similar structure for finding prediction intervals. At the end of the tutorial, there is a challenge to attempt in order to check the material is well-understood.
